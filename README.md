# South Carolina Language Map

## Description:

A Full Stack web application for collecting and displaying sites in South Carolina where specific languages are spoken. Sites are displayed on a map, are searchable, and display the details of the language spoken there.

Administrators have access to table views of the Sites, Languages, and Language Categories, with the ability to add, remove, and edit them. Administrators also have the ability to add other administrators.

## Screen Shot

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Create database and tables

- Create a new database called `sc_language_map`
- Run the code in database.sql to initialize the tables and import data

If you would like to name your database something else, you will need to change `sc_language_map` to the name of your new database name in `server/modules/pool.js`

## Development Setup Instructions

- Fork and Clone
- Babel needs extra configuration to avoid attempting to transpile Mapbox. To make sure the map canvas renders appropriately, follow these instructions:
  - Paste the following into package.json:
    ```
    "browserslist": {
      "production": [
        ">0.2%",
        "not dead",
        "not op_mini all",
        "not chrome < 51",
        "not safari < 10"
      ],
      "development": [
        "last 1 chrome version",
        "last 1 firefox version",
        "last 1 safari version"
      ]
    }
    ```
  - run `npx browserslist@latest --update-db` 
- Run `npm install`
- Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
  ```
  SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
  REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=mapboxAcessToken
  ```
   - While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [https://passwordsgenerator.net/](https://passwordsgenerator.net/). If you don't do this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you will get a warning.
   - In addition, you will need to replace `mapboxAccessToken` with a personal or public token from [https://mapbox.com](https://mapbox.com)
- Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
- Run `npm run server`
- Run `npm run client`
- Navigate to `localhost:3000`

## Debugging

To debug, you will need to run the client-side separately from the server. Start the client by running the command `npm run client`. Start the debugging server by selecting the Debug button.

Then make sure `Launch Program` is selected from the dropdown, then click the green play arrow.

## Testing Routes with Postman

To use Postman with this repo, you will need to set up requests in Postman to register a user and login a user at a minimum.

Keep in mind that once you using the login route, Postman will manage your session cookie for you just like a browser, ensuring it is sent with each subsequent request. If you delete the `localhost` cookie in Postman, it will effectively log you out.

1. Start the server - `npm run server`
2. Import the sample routes JSON file [v2](./PostmanPrimeSoloRoutesv2.json) by clicking `Import` in Postman. Select the file.
3. Click `Collections` and `Send` the following three calls in order:
   1. `POST /api/user/register` registers a new user, see body to change username/password
   2. `POST /api/user/login` will login a user, see body to change username/password
   3. `GET /api/user` will get user information, by default it's not very much

After running the login route above, you can try any other route you've created that requires a logged in user!

## Production Build

Before pushing to Heroku, run `npm run build` in terminal. This will create a build folder that contains the code Heroku will be pointed at. You can test this build by typing `npm start`. Keep in mind that `npm start` will let you preview the production build but will **not** auto update.

- Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
- Run `npm start`
- Navigate to `localhost:5000`

## Lay of the Land

There are a few videos linked below that show a walkthrough the client and sever setup to help acclimatize to the boilerplate. Please take some time to watch the videos in order to get a better understanding of what the boilerplate is like.

- [Initial Set](https://vimeo.com/453297271)
- [Server Walkthrough](https://vimeo.com/453297212)
- [Client Walkthrough](https://vimeo.com/453297124)

Directory Structure:

- `src/` contains the React application
- `public/` contains static assets for the client-side
- `build/` after you build the project, contains the transpiled code from `src/` and `public/` that will be viewed on the production site
- `server/` contains the Express App

This code is also heavily commented. We recommend reading through the comments, getting a lay of the land, and becoming comfortable with how the code works before you start making too many changes. If you're wondering where to start, consider reading through component file comments in the following order:

- src/components
  - App/App
  - Footer/Footer
  - Nav/Nav
  - AboutPage/AboutPage
  - InfoPage/InfoPage
  - UserPage/UserPage
  - LoginPage/LoginPage
  - RegisterPage/RegisterPage
  - LogOutButton/LogOutButton
  - ProtectedRoute/ProtectedRoute

## Deployment

1. Create a new Heroku project
1. Link the Heroku project to the project GitHub Repo
1. Create an Heroku Postgres database
1. Connect to the Heroku Postgres database from Postico
1. Create the necessary tables
1. Add an environment variable for `SERVER_SESSION_SECRET` with a nice random string for security
1. In the deploy section, select manual deploy

## Update Documentation

Customize this ReadMe and the code comments in this project to read less like a starter repo and more like a project. Here is an example: https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2
